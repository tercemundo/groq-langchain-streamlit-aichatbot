# March 3rd Update! "One-Click Installation and Set Up of Groq and Streamlit on Github Codespaces" 

I updated the original code (worked perfectly locally) that I forked from the cool dev at https://github.com/definitive-io/ in order to run Groq and the Streamlit App front end on Github CodeSpaces https://github.com/codespaces.  

For the apps code to run on Github Codespaces I created two new folders and two new files.  

One folder is named .devcontainer and contains a devcontainer.json file and the other folder is named .streamlit and contains a config.toml file.

# Groq LangChain Conversational Chatbot

This repository contains a Streamlit application that allows users to interact with a conversational chatbot powered by the LangChain API. The application uses the Groq API to generate responses and maintains a history of the conversation to provide context for the chatbot's responses.

## Features

- **Conversational Interface**: The application provides a conversational interface where users can ask questions or make statements, and the chatbot responds accordingly.

- **Contextual Responses**: The application maintains a history of the conversation, which is used to provide context for the chatbot's responses.

- **LangChain Integration**: The chatbot is powered by the LangChain API, which uses advanced natural language processing techniques to generate human-like responses.

## Usage

To use this application, you need to have Streamlit and the other required Python libraries installed. You also need to have a Groq API key, which you can obtain by signing up on the Groq website.

Once you have the necessary requirements, you can run the application by executing the script with Streamlit:

```shell
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start the Streamlit server and open the application in your web browser. You can then interact with the chatbot, and the application will generate responses based on the history of the conversation.
