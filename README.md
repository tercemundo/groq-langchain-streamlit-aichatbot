# March 3rd Update!  
I updated the code from the original code https://github.com/definitive-io/conversational-chatbot-groq that I forked from the cool dev https://github.com/definitive-io/.  The code ran perfectly locally however it would not run when you selected the "CODE" "RUN IN CODESPACES" Green button.  ue to a fix a Running in Codespaces error.  The original code is intended to run Groq and the Streamlit front end on your local computer.

# Groq LangChain Conversational Chatbot

This repository contains a Streamlit application that allows users to interact with a conversational chatbot powered by the LangChain API. The application uses the Groq API to generate responses and maintains a history of the conversation to provide context for the chatbot's responses.

## Features

- **Conversational Interface**: The application provides a conversational interface where users can ask questions or make statements, and the chatbot responds accordingly.

- **Contextual Responses**: The application maintains a history of the conversation, which is used to provide context for the chatbot's responses.

- **LangChain Integration**: The chatbot is powered by the LangChain API, which uses advanced natural language processing techniques to generate human-like responses.

## Usage

To use this application, you need to have Streamlit and the other required Python libraries installed. You also need to have a Groq API key, which you can obtain by signing up on the Groq website.

Once you have the necessary requirements, you can run the application by executing the script with Streamlit:

```shell
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start the Streamlit server and open the application in your web browser. You can then interact with the chatbot, and the application will generate responses based on the history of the conversation.
